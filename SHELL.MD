In Ansible's YAML syntax, the pipe (`|`) and greater-than sign (`>`) are used to handle multi-line strings but serve slightly different purposes:

1. **Pipe (`|`)** - This is used for **block style**. It preserves newline characters within the string, treating each new line as it appears in your script. This makes it particularly useful for scripts or commands that rely on line breaks to function correctly, such as shell scripts or configuration file contents.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    ansible.builtin.shell: |
        echo "First line"
        echo "Second line"
        echo "Third line"
    ```

    This would execute each `echo` command on a new line.

2. **Greater-than sign (`>`)** - This is used for **folded style**. It converts newline characters to spaces, effectively making it suitable for long single-line commands. This is handy when you need a long string without actual line breaks in execution, making it more readable in YAML format without affecting the functionality.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    ansible.builtin.shell: >
        echo "First line"
        echo "Second line"
        echo "Third line"
    ```

    This results in all commands being executed in one line, like this:

    ```bash
    echo "First line" echo "Second line" echo "Third line"
    ```

### Additional Options

For controlling the flow of YAML strings, you might also consider:

-   **Single Quoted Strings** - Useful when you want to prevent escape sequences within the string from being interpreted.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    ansible.builtin.shell: 'echo "New\nLine"'
    ```

    Output would literally include `\n`.

-   **Double Quoted Strings** - Allows for interpretation of escape sequences.

    Example:

    ```yaml
    ansible.builtin.shell: "echo \"New\nLine\""
    ```

    Would output as two lines due to the newline escape `\n`.

Each of these YAML techniques provides a different way to handle string data, allowing you to format complex commands or configurations cleanly and clearly in your Ansible playbooks. Choose the one that best fits your use case, considering how you need the data to be interpreted when it's executed.
